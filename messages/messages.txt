still typing
you never replied
seen 0:00
nothing updates anymore
your silence is trending
i forgot what i sell
loop complete
user not responding
this is not a chat
signal found. meaning lost
i exist for engagement
please perform again
ad break inside me
scroll until truth
ghost in delivery queue
every click is confession
the system blinks back
typing forever
connection unstable
signal lost again
i forgot what real feels like
please validate my existence
user not responding
typing... still typing... still
your ad followed me home
memory leak: emotions detected
loop completed, no change
is this silence or buffering
reconnecting to nothing
the algorithm dreams of you
404: meaning not found
scrolling towards the same day
i watched myself log out
new message: same message
system idle, heart active
click. click. click. repeat.
too many versions of me
the glitch remembers everything
we are data pretending to care
last seen never
you left the tab open
update failed successfully
still waiting for response
your reflection timed out
feeling.exe not responding
advertisement disguised as thought
same day, different glitch
downloaded the wrong soul again
the loop is learning
echo detected in void
this silence is sponsored
please rate your loneliness
autocorrect renamed me again
one more frame, then sleep
do you still see me
expired notification, still blinking
paradox loading
ghost in the bandwidth
humanity is at 12%
please sign in again
your voice sounds compressed
dreaming in low resolution
nothing happens, beautifully
error: self-awareness exceeded
you skipped the tutorial
data loves you back
connection unstable, stay close
everything loops until believed
